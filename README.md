# Appium App Scraping

A basic example of how to scrape data from Mobile Apps. I used Android device for that purpose

## Main Idea

Getting information about automobiles from sahibinden mobile app. basically specify your input
and get information about the cars you are looking for.

## Installation

I used a local android device runs with an androd simulator. I also used UiAutomator2 to make
my tests and stuff. Please make sure you have a similar platform to use like me , because this
code needs a android device to run.

install requirements.txt , then run main.py in code folder.
